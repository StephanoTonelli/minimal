    During my time at the startup, I had the exciting opportunity to design private gas stations tailored specifically for trucks. The process began with carefully analyzing the blueprints of the locations using AutoCAD, working collaboratively with my team to identify the best layout for efficient and functional gas stations. Once the blueprints were finalized, I transitioned to SolidWorks to create detailed 3D views of the gas stations. This comprehensive approach allowed us to visualize the stations in three dimensions, ensuring that the design met the specific needs of truck drivers and facilitated smooth operations.
