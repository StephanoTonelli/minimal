    I had the pleasure of designing a versatile metal camping table for a customer who owns a Jeep and enjoys camping adventures. The objective was to create a practical and functional table that could be easily attached to the trunk door of the Jeep, serving as a kitchen extension during camping trips. Leveraging SolidWorks, I meticulously crafted the design, accounting for precise measurements and bends in 1.2mm metal sheets to ensure a seamless and secure fit onto the Jeep trunk door. The final product combined functionality, durability, and aesthetic appeal, enriching the camping experience for the customer.
