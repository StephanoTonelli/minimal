I built an application that reads data from six databases, one for each month, and identifies which salesperson has sold more than R$55,000. The first person to reach this goal will win a trip for their family at the end of the year. The program will also send a text message notification to the manager when an employee reaches the goal. I used Python programming language to build the application and Pandas library.
