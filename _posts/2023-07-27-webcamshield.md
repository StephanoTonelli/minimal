    As a proactive measure to enhance privacy and security in the workplace, I designed a Webcam Protector for my colleagues' notebooks. The Webcam Protector is a 3D-printed accessory created using Autodesk Fusion 360, offering a simple and effective solution to cover built-in webcams when not in use. By utilizing my Ender 3 3D printer and ABS plastic filament, I successfully brought the design to life, ensuring durability and practicality for everyday use.
