<h3>Introduction:</h3>
<p style="font-size:0.8em">
My I30 car had a broken lid that protected the screw holding the door handle, and try as I might I couldnt find anywhere that sold that part for replacemnt, so I thought why don`t i just print it.
</p>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
  <ul style="font-size:0.8em">
  <li>Fusion 360 (CAD): I utilized CAD software Fusion 360 to create detailed and precise 3D model.</li>
  <li>Bambu Studio (Slicer): I utilized the slicer to optimize the printing process of the model.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Design:</h3>
<p style="font-size:0.8em">
In order to desigh the part i removed the one from the other door, took some mesurements with my paquimeter and took some profile pictures from 2 angles:

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
Based on the pictures and mesurements I started designing the part.
</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
The first step is uploading the Photos to Fusion 360 in order to draw the profile shape, and once I`ve done it for the lateral and top it's just a matter of adjusting the design with the mesurements I have, and after a few tries and improvements this was my final design result:

<h3>Printing:</h3>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
For printing we have to think about the structure of the part and how it will receive stress, if the force exerted on the part is perpendicular to the printing layers it's most likely for the part to breake in the weaker points.

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
Therefore we need to print the part in a way that maximizes it's strenght. This could be fixed just by printing in a different orientation, but some things must be considered.
</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
When we want to optmize the strenght  of the part the best way would be printing in a orientation that no force would be aplied perpendicular to that, at least not in it's weakest spot, but doing so the print must be done with the help of a lot o supports which can be bad for the finishing appearance of the part.

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
In that case some times we must come to a compromize of both appearance and strenght, where the part will have a great finish and not break in its main points.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
This project presented a unique challenge: creating a durable replacement for a car part that was not readily available on the market. Through careful measurement, thoughtful design, and strategic printing orientation, I successfully fabricated a lid that not only fits perfectly but also withstands the mechanical stress it faces during regular use.

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
This endeavor not only served as a testament to the versatility and utility of 3D printing in solving everyday problems but also enhanced my skills in design optimization and mechanical engineering principles. By balancing strength and aesthetic considerations, the project illustrates the intricate interplay between form and function in engineering design, offering valuable insights into the practical applications of additive manufacturing in automotive repair.
