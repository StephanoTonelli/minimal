    I had the incredible opportunity to design vintage VCC (Vintage Control Line) remote-controlled airplanes for a prestigious company. The project involved a harmonious fusion of traditional blueprints from vintage airplanes and contemporary engineering techniques. Working closely with the company owner, I meticulously adjusted the measurements and implemented cutting-edge building techniques to ensure optimal performance and authenticity. Utilizing SolidWorks, I crafted the entire aircraft in detailed 3D models, paving the way for the construction of plywood building kits that enthusiasts could assemble and cherish.
