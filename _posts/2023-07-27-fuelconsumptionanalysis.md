  <p style="font-size:0.8em">As an Operation Analyst at a startup, I developed a robust Power BI dashboard that became a crucial tool for data analysis. The objective was to analyze data collected from monitoring devices installed on trucks. The data included GPS location, terrain inclination, odometer readings, driver names, acceleration, speed, and abrupt maneuvers, among other parameters. I received Excel files for each trip and applied data cleaning and preprocessing to remove errors, duplicates, and missing data.</p>

  <p style="font-size:0.8em">The initial steps involved creating labels and performing calculations to generate additional insights. For each trip, I added labels for origin, main road, and destination, allowing for easy comparisons across different days or drivers. I calculated vehicle fuel consumption using fuel tank volume and odometer data. Altitude information was used to determine if the vehicle was traveling uphill or downhill during each second of the trip.</p>

  <p style="font-size:0.8em">To streamline data updates, I developed a system that allowed me to place new edited files in a specific folder. The Power BI dashboard would then automatically update with the new data.</p>

  <p style="font-size:0.8em">The core analysis focused on visualizations that provided valuable insights to optimize truck trips and reduce costs. The most significant visualization was a graph plotting fuel level against distance for each trip, facilitating a comparison of trip efficiency on similar routes. I integrated a Google Maps view alongside this graph for a comprehensive route analysis. Additional graphs included acceleration over inclination and altitude over distance, aiding in identifying factors influencing fuel consumption and acceleration patterns. To pinpoint areas of concern, I marked points on the main fuel consumption graph corresponding to abrupt maneuvers during the trip.</p>

  <p style="font-size:0.8em">The dashboard served a dual purpose: not only did it improve fuel efficiency and reduce trip costs, but it also motivated drivers to adopt better driving practices and achieve superior results.</p>

  <p style="font-size:0.8em">The company adopted my dashboard as their primary analysis tool and for presenting to potential clients.</p>

  <h2>Future Enhancements:</h2>
  <p style="font-size:0.8em">Although I left the company, future steps for enhancing the dashboard included:</p>

  <ul style="font-size:0.8em">
        <li>Online Database Integration: Modify the dashboard to retrieve data directly from an online database, ensuring real-time data updates and eliminating manual file handling.</li>
        <li>Setting Trip Fuel Consumption Goals: Using accumulated data, establish fuel consumption targets for each trip. This would enable a focused effort to replicate successful trips and further optimize fuel efficiency.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="font-size:0.8em">With the success of this project, the Power BI dashboard proved instrumental in data-driven decision-making and contributed significantly to the startup's operational efficiency and cost reduction efforts.</p>
