<p style="font-size:0.8em">During my internship, I developed a valuable Excel tool called the "Knowledge Glossary" that served as a repository for organizing and storing every new word or knowledge I acquired during the internship. The tool proved to be so effective and beneficial that it caught the attention of the HR boss, who encouraged me to share it with all the other interns.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">The main objective of the Knowledge Glossary was to facilitate the accumulation and easy retrieval of new learnings and insights gained throughout the internship. As an intern, I encountered a wide range of new concepts, terminologies, and information on a daily basis. Keeping track of this wealth of knowledge was essential for personal growth and professional development.</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">The Excel tool consisted of the following key features:</p>

<ul style="font-size:0.8em">
    <li>Entry Management: The tool allowed me to enter new words, terminologies, and explanations in a structured format. Each entry included the word or concept and its definitionand</li>
    <li>Link: I left a space for liks so anyone could learn more about the subject.</li>
    <li>Search and Filter: The tool provided a search and filter functionality, allowing me to quickly locate specific entries based on keywords, dates, or categories. This feature enhanced efficiency in accessing previously learned information.</li>
    <li>Revision and Updates: As my understanding of certain terms evolved or as I encountered new insights related to existing entries, I could easily revise and update the glossary to ensure accuracy and completeness.</li>
    <li>Sharing Capability: Upon the HR boss's recommendation, I shared the tool with other interns to access and benefit from the Knowledge Glossary. This encouraged a culture of shared learning and contributed to the overall growth of the intern community.</li>
</ul>
