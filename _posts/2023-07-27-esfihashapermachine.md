    I was tasked by a company to design a budget-friendly Esfiha Shaper Machine for their kitchen, aimed at improving productivity and efficiency in their food production process. The objective was to create a version of the machine using readily available materials, with a focus on using cut MDF sheets coated with food-safe resin for cost-effectiveness.

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul style="font-size:0.8em">
    <li>Cost-Effective Design: The machine was meticulously designed to utilize affordable materials, primarily cut MDF sheets, to reduce manufacturing costs without compromising functionality.</li>
    <li>Food-Safe Resin Coating: To ensure compliance with food safety standards, the MDF sheets were coated with a food-safe resin, making the machine suitable for use in a kitchen environment.</li>
    <li>Enhanced Productivity: The Esfiha Shaper Machine was engineered to streamline the process of shaping Esfiha dough, significantly increasing productivity in the kitchen.</li>
    <li>Ergonomic and User-Friendly: The design prioritized ease of use and maintenance, allowing kitchen staff to operate the machine with minimal training.</li>
    <li>Compact and Space-Saving: The compact footprint of the machine was optimized to fit seamlessly into the existing kitchen layout, saving valuable workspace.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
  <ul style="font-size:0.8em">
    <li>Fusion 360: I employed Autodesk Fusion 360, a 3D CAD/CAM tool, to create a detailed and precise virtual model of the Esfiha Shaper Machine.</li>
    <li>MDF Sheets: The main structural components of the machine were crafted from cut MDF (Medium-Density Fiberboard) sheets, a cost-effective and easily accessible material.</li>
    <li>Food-Safe Resin: To meet hygiene and food safety requirements, the MDF sheets were coated with a food-safe resin, providing a smooth, durable, and non-porous surface.</li>
  </ul>
