<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
A client ask me to help develop a Dog feeder based on Rings that could be stacked on top of each other to lift the bowl high enough for each dog`s size making it healthier for the animal`s back.
</p>

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
  <ul style="font-size:0.8em">
  <li>Fusion 360 (CAD): I utilized CAD software Fusion 360 to create detailed and precise 3D model.</li>
  <li>Bambu Studio (Slicer): I utilized the slicer to optimize the printing process of the model.</li>
  </ul>

<h3>Design:</h3>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
I started with getting all dimentions of the desired bowl, once I got all I needed I did the first sketch with the sugested mechanism of locking each ring to the other, which consisted in a inverted L shaped lock.
</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
As you can see the L shaped lock had a lot of issues when printings, making the process of removing the supports harder than it needs to be and loosing the smooth finish of the printing.
</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
After realizing that, I opted for a circle shaped lock that needed less support when printing and when removing the support it would take seconds and leave a good finishing.

<h3>Printing:</h3>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
But I still had a problem what is the tolerance that i should use for that lock to hold everything and last a long time, but to be at the same time eazy to lock and unlock iwth not much effort.
So in order to figure that out I started printing tests, I couldnt possibly print a whole new ring for each test and spend kilos of filament so i started cutting the object in a way i could only print the exact parts i needed to test, and after a few iterations i got to the perfect print to test my tolerance.
</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
The first cut I did was done in Fusion 360 to print only an arch that had the locking mechanism.

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
And then on my slicer program (Bambu Labs Studio) I cutted only the lock itself, minimizing the time and filament used for each test.

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
With only the small change on the slicer I saved half the cost in filament (5g/print) and 10min/print.
</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
At the end the tolerance that started with 0,4mm came to -0,1mm. And here is the final result of the project.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<p style="font-size:0.8em">
Through the successful completion of this customizable dog feeder project, I not only refined my 3D printing skills but also demonstrated the capability to innovate and adapt in response to unforeseen challenges. The transition from an L-shaped to a circle-shaped lock exemplifies a critical approach to problem-solving, enhancing the product's usability and manufacturing efficiency. Furthermore, the iterative process of testing and adjusting the lock's tolerance underscores a commitment to precision and durability, ensuring the feeder's long-term functionality and ease of use. 
</p>

<p style="font-size:0.8em">
This project not only resulted in a practical product that improves the well-being of pets but also provided invaluable insights into design optimization and resource management. Moving forward, the experience and knowledge gained lay a solid foundation for future endeavors in product design and additive manufacturing.
