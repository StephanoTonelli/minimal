     I had the privilege of designing a highly efficient stillage for transporting plastic round tables for the esteemed Brisbane Racing Club. The objective was to address the shortcomings of the old stillage, which lacked practicality, often caused damage to the tables, and occupied excessive storage space. My innovative design overcame these challenges, providing a compact and robust solution that streamlined the transportation and storage of the tables for events on the lawn. The new stillage maximized space utilization, improved table protection, and enhanced ease of handling with a forklift.
