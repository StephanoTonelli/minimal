    As a pet owner who enjoys taking my dog for daily walks, I designed a practical and convenient Plastic Bag Dispenser. The dispenser serves as a handy container to store bags used for cleaning up after my dog during walks. Created using Autodesk Fusion 360, the dispenser's design is tailored to fit standard plastic bags, ensuring ease of use and portability. Utilizing my Ender 3 3D printer and ABS plastic filament, I brought the design to life, producing a durable and reliable tool for every dog-walking adventure.

  <h3>Key Features:</h3>
  <ul style="font-size:0.8em">
    <li>Customized Design: The Plastic Bag Dispenser's 3D model in Fusion 360 was tailored to perfectly fit standard plastic bags, ensuring a snug and secure fit.</li>
    <li>Compact and Portable: The dispenser's design offers a lightweight and compact solution, easily attachable to my dog's leash or carried in a pocket during walks.</li>
    <li>User-Friendly Operation: With a simple pull-and-tear mechanism, the dispenser allows quick and easy access to plastic bags, streamlining the waste cleanup process.</li>
    <li>Durable ABS Plastic: The dispenser was 3D printed using ABS plastic filament, providing the necessary strength and resilience for repeated use outdoors.</li>
    <li>Eco-Friendly: By reusing plastic bags, the dispenser promotes environmental consciousness and reduces single-use plastic waste during dog walks.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
  <ul style="font-size:0.8em">
    <li>Autodesk Fusion 360: I employed Fusion 360, a versatile 3D CAD software, to design and customize the Plastic Bag Dispenser, ensuring it accommodates standard plastic bags with precision.</li>
    <li>Ender 3 3D Printer: The Ender 3 3D printer played a crucial role in manufacturing the Plastic Bag Dispenser, providing precise printing and a reliable final product.</li>
    <li>ABS Plastic Filament: I selected ABS plastic filament for its durability, making the dispenser suitable for outdoor use and exposure to various weather conditions.</li>
    <li>Cura Slicer: Using Cura slicer software, I prepared the 3D model for printing, generating the necessary G-code for the Ender 3 printer.</li>
  </ul>
